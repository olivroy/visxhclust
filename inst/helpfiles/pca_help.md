### Principal component analysis

This tab has two plots to help understand the structure of the data used for clustering:

* **2D projection**: this is a projection of the first two PCs annotated with cluster colors.
* **Drivers plot**: this plot shows the strength of the absolute correlation between the original data and the first 8 principal components.
