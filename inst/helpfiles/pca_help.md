### Principal component analysis

This tab has two plots to help understand a bit more the structure of the data used for clustering:

* **2D projection**: this is a projection of two selected PCs annotated with cluster colors.
* **Drivers plot**: this plot shows the strength of the absolute correlation between the original data and the first 8 principal components. The visual part of this plot is inspired by [David Watson's bioplotr package](https://github.com/dswatson/bioplotr).
