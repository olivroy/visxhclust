### Data overview

This tab contains three functions:

* **Correlation heatmap:** the heatmap is aimed to support feature selection and displays the correlation among the currently selected features.
* **Highly correlated variables:** for the pairs of variables matching the threshold, set at the bottom of the sidebar, there is a table showing the correlation and its significance between these features.
* **Histograms:** each feature can be inspected indivdually through the histogram. It is also possible to display the scaled feature, to see how it's actually used in the clustering method.
