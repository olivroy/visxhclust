### Data overview

This tab contains three functions:

* **Correlation heatmap:** the heatmap is aimed to support feature selection and displays the correlation among the currently selected features.
* **Highly correlated variables:** a table with variables and correlation that match the threshold set at the bottom of the sidebar, with the corresponding significance level. For pairs of variables that are *not* significantly lower than the threshold, one of the pair is excluded (the second in alphabetical order).
* **Histograms:** to visualize each feature separately and see the effect the of the selected scaling.
