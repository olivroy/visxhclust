### Gap statistic

This tab enables computing the Gap statistic with a user-defined number of boostrap samples. You can also choose a method to highlight the *optimal* number of clusters k. For more information about the underlying functions, check the documentation of the [cluster package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cluster). For Gap statistic in general, check the original [published article](https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9868.00293) by Tibshirani et al., 2001.
