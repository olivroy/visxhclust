### Significance testing

This tab shows the results of Dunn's multiple comparisons test for a specific variable. The selection dropdown will only display variables that were not used for computing clusters. Additionally, the test will only work for two or more clusters. The boxplots show, across the clusters, the distributions of the feature chosen for comparison. Below that, line plots show the standardised profile of the clusters for the features used for clustering.
