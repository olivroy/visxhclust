### Significance testing

This tab shows the results of Dunn's multiple comparisons test for a specific variable. The selection dropdown will only display variables that were *not* used for computing clusters. Additionally, the test will only work for two or more clusters. The boxplots show, across the clusters, the distributions of the feature chosen for comparison.

The results displayed are the output of the dunn.test function from the [dunn.test](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dunn.test/index.html) package.
