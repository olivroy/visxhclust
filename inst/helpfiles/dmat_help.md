### Distance matrix

This tab contains two views:

* **Projection**: the distance matrix is projected using the classic multidimensional scaling algorithm (stats::cmdscale() in R), and points are annotated with the cluster colors.
* **Heatmap**: the distance matrix is projected as a 2D heatmap, showing pairwise distances. Note that for larger datasets this will be very slow.
