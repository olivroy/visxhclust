### Removing rows

This tab enables removal of rows from the current dataset, e.g. to remove outliers. To do that, select a cluster to inspect and select the rows you want to remove, then click on the button. When you do that, the clusters will be recomputed with the new dataset. You can also click on "Keep only this cluster" to remove all data except the currently selected cluster.  **Note: this operation cannot be undone. Reload the file to begin again.**
