### Removing subjects

This tab enables removal of subjects from the current dataset, e.g. to remove outliers. To do that, select a cluster to inspect and select the rows you want to remove, then click on the button. When you do that, the clusters will be recomputed with the new dataset. **Note: this operation cannot be undone. Reload the file to begin again.**
