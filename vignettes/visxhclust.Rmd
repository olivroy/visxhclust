This is a visual introduction to the visxhclust Shiny app -- note that almost every tab in the application has a corresponding help icon with more information and tips. If you're here within RStudio you might have loaded the package. If not, you can start from:

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
library(visxhclust)
```

To open the Shiny app you just have to:

```{r run, eval=FALSE}
run_app()
```
